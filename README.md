# Data Structures and Algorithms for Big Data
In this project, I implemented C++ stl vectors to store 6.4GB data containing 1.6M clicking information of the company named Criteo. There are 4 main functions I want to implement. The first one is to get the information whether a user make a purchase of the product he click at a specific time. The second one is to find the common purchase of two users. The third one is two know the conversion rate(purchases/clicks) of specific users. The last one is to know all the products a user buy. These operations can cost a lot of time because there are 1.6M lines of data. My main work is to store these data in a specific way so that I can get information by implementing binary search.

### A program that can help gain access to specific data from tens of millions pieces of data in a short time

## Task
Think of the data structures and algorithms that can help people query the data with specific restrictions in a short time.

### Run Locally
* Run this Command: git clone <https://github.com/b05702057/Operation-Management-Algorithm-Design.git>
* Run this Command: make
* Run this Command: ./demo
* Enter the queries

### Note
* You can know how the detail of the task from the file "Task_Description.pdf".
* You can know how to query the data from the file "Task_Specifications.md".
