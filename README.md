# Big-Data-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
In this project, I implemented C++ stl vectors to store 6.4GB data containing 1.6M clicking information of the company named Criteo. There are 4 main functions I want to implement. The first one is to get the information whether a user make a purchase of the product he click at a specific time. The second one is to find the common purchase of two users. The third one is two know the conversion rate(purchases/clicks) of specific users. The last one is to know all the products a user buy. These operations can cost a lot of time because there are 1.6M lines of data. My main work is to store these data in a specific way so that I can get information by implementing binary search.
